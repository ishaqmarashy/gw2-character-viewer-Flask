# Guildwars 2 character viewer

## Description

This project efficiently queries the Guild Wars 2 (GW2) API for character details.
It employs MongoDB, Flask, and Python to create a high-performance proxy server.
MongoDB serves as a cache, reducing response times by checking it before querying the GW2 API.
